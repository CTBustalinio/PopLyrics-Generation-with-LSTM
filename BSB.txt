"I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
And everything I do
I wanna be with you

I'd like to know your policy
When it comes to me
I'd like to know what's in your mind
It's not easy to see
I know now what I feel
And what to do
I wanna be with you

And I'll be waiting
Until you face the truth
When the light is fading
You know what I wanna do

I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
(You know it's true)
And everything I do
(Is for you baby)
I wanna be with you
(Oh with you)
Everybody say hey!
Yeah
See you once again
Yeah
Everybody swing
Yeah
Everybody
Yeah
Everybody swing

Wish you'd come and set me free
So that I can see
All the things I've left behind
What's missing in me
I'm looking for a sign
In the things you do
I wanna be with you

And I'll be waiting
Until you face the truth
When the light is fading
You know what I wanna do

I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
(You know it's true)
And everything I do
(Is for you baby)
I wanna be with you
(Oh with you)
Everybody say hey!
Yeah
See you once again
Yeah
Everybody swing
Yeah
Everybody
Yeah
Everybody swing

I wanna be with you
It's crazy but it's true
And everything I do
(Oh, oh, oh)
I wanna be with you

I wanna be with you
(Yeah)
It's crazy but it's true
(Yeah)
And everything I do
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
It's crazy but it's true
(It's crazy but it's true)
And everything I do
(and everything I do)
I wanna be with you
(I wanna be with you)
Hey
And everything I do
I wanna be with you"

"Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see?

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
Quit playin' games

Baby, baby, the love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hangin' here forever
Oh, baby, baby, this is not a lie
Let's stop this tonight

Baby
Quit playin' games

Nanana...

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

I should've known from the start
With my heart
With my heart
With my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Nanana...

Quit playin' games with my heart
With my heart
With my heart

"As long as you love me

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance

And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't care)

Who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (Yeah-ah-ah)
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin' from (I don't care)
As long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (Who you are)
Where you're from (Where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (You love me)

"Show me the meaning of being lonely

So many words for the broken heart
It's hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to believe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free, I can feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with?
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say, forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (Endless love)
There's no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are
There's something missing in my heart

There's nowhere to run, I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul

You are missing in my heart
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with? (Tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are (Where you are)
There's something missing in my heart (You are missing in my heart)

Show me the meaning of being lonely (Being lonely)

I should have said, ""No, someone's waiting for me...""
But I called my girl up and said

""Listen baby, I'm sorry

Now two years done, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done

And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

And then he doesn't wanna know

I'm tellin you he'll eat you up from inside

Get another Boyfriend

Was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses that turned you on?

Three, two you're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

I'm telling you, go get on with your life
Stop acting like you're givin up

Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
Just another playa', playing in the name of love
I've seen enough, now this must come to an end
Get another Boyfriend

""Why?"" ""Get another Boyfriend""

Hear me out
You must know
What it's all about, baby
That he's just a player in love
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
Just another playa', playing in the name of love
I've seen enough, now this must come to an end
Get another Boyfriend

Listen, I mean it
There's nothing that he's worthy of
Just another playa', playing in the name of love
I've seen enough, now this must come to an end
Get another Boyfriend

"Even the  lovers makes a mistake sometimes
Like any other
Fall out and lose his mind
And I'm sorry for the things I did
For your teardrops over words I said
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again?

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

Whatever happened
I know that I was wrong, oh yes
Can you believe me
Maybe your faith is gone, but is it?
But I love you and I always will
So I wonder if you want me still
Can you forgive me
And open your heart once again, oh yeah

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

I'd do anything to make it up to you
So please understand
And open your heart once again

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah it's true
Without you I would fall apart

It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah it' true
Without you I would fall apart

Oh...
Oh yeah...

"Looking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do
Could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go (oh)
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say (yeah)
I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing, I try to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day
The day you slipped away

And I just want you to know ('cause I can't fight it)
That I've been fighting to let you go (oh)
Some days I make it through (and then there's)
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say (I have to say, I)
I would do it all again

I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end

But still I have to say (but still I have to say)
No, I would do it all again
Just want you to know"

"Who are you now?
Are you still the same
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last (to last)

I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

No no
Wish I could find you
Just like you found me
Then I would never let you go (without you)

Though everything's been said and done (yeah)
I still feel you (I still feel you)
Like I'm right beside you (like I'm right beside you)
But still no (still no word) word from you"

"Close your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside (oh yeah)
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss (ohh)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way?
If I can't have you
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way
If I can't have you

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now (now)
Caught by the taste of your kiss (I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know

"When you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
And no it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you too"

"First off I cant keep a promise 
I'm no one to count on at all

You're bigger

Cuz you're still here 
Your feet stuck to the ground 
Despite how silly it sounds 
You're bigger

Often I'm blacker than white 
Add on my uncanny ego 
No ones less humbled than I

Yeah I swear I'll make'em up to you 
Before you're going heaven knows 
Just let me make it better 
I'll try to measure up
