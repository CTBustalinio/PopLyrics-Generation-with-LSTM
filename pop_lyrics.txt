It was so easy that night
Shoulda been strong, yeah, I lied
Nobody gets me like you

Couldn't keep hold of you then
How could I know what you meant?
There was nothing to compare to

Keisha:
I know everything changes
All the cities and faces
But I know how I feel about you

There's a mountain between us
But there's one thing I'm sure of
That I know how I feel about you

All:
Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Amelle:
All that it takes, one more chance
Don't let our last kiss be our last 
Keisha:
Give me tonight and I'll show you

I know everything changes
I don't care where it takes us
Cos I know how I feel about you

All:
Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Heidi: 
Not a day passed me by
Not a day passed me by
When I don't think about you
And there's no moving on
'Cause I know you're the one
And I can't be without you

All: 
Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now

Can we bring yesterday back around?
'Cause I know how I feel about you now
I was dumb, I was wrong, I let you down
But I know how I feel about you now
But I know how I feel about you now
But I know how I feel about you now"@@@@"I am in love with what we are
Not what we should be
And I am, I am starstruck with every part
Of this whole story

So if it's just tonight
The animal inside, let it live and die
Like it's the end of time
Like everything inside, let it live and die 

This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now, just come and love me like we're gonna die

I'm not asleep, I'm up for the fight
Into the magic
And I don't want the concrete, I am alive
Comes with the tragic

So if it's just tonight
The animal inside, let it live and die 

This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now, just come and love me like we're gonna die

This is our last chance to give me your hands
'Cause the world is spinning at the speed of light
The night is fading, heart is racing
Now, just come and love me like we're gonna die"@@@@"(Flo Rida)

I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
No, I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything, opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I've cried
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes"@@@@"I heard you're feeling 
Nothing's going right
Why don't you let me 
Stop by

The clock is ticking
Running out of time
So we should party
All night

So cover your eyes
I have a surprise
I hope you got a healthy appetite
If you wanna dance
If you want it all
You know that I'm the girl that you should call

Boy, when you're with me
I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet
So you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

Give you something good to celebrate

Pop your confetti
Pop the PÃ©rignon

Like a disco ball

Gonna pull an all-nighter.

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
'Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending
With a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But li'l mama's so dope
I messed around and got addicted

Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy

You touch me and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you let's just give it up and get down
And get down and get down

So come on
Won't you give me something to remember
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out
Even though we couldn't last forever, baby
You know what I want right now

Hit me one more time, it's so amazing
How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out

Inside out

I know that we probably shouldn't do this
Wake up in the morning feeling stupid
Said that we were done but you're all up on me
Said that we were done but you're all up on me

Tell me how we got in this position
Guess I gotta get you out my system
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy

But you don't really mind
It's not the first time
And you know it, don't you now
Tell me why it is you only smile inside
But when you break me into nothing
Don't you know

It's not like I haven't tried
Over and over again
Stupid fights
Wrong or right
Goodbye...

[Chorus:]
I Remember when you came with me that night
We said forever, that you would never let me go
But here I am again
With nothing left inside
No I don't wanna but I gotta let you go

You're the one mistake
I really didn't mind
So beautiful, unmercifully
Took me down
Too little and too late
So now I know your kind
You fake it easy, just to please me
Don't you know

It's not like we haven't tried
Over and over again
Sleepless nights wrong or right
Goodbye...

What's the point of playing a game you're gonna lose?
What's the point in saying you love me like a friend?
What's the point in saying it's never gonna end?

You're too proud to say that you made a mistake
You're a coward 'til the end
I don't wanna admit that we're not gonna fit
No, I'm not the type that you like
Why don't we just pretend?

Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know
I can't let you go, can't let you go
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know

You only ever touch me in the dark
Only if we're drinking can you see my spark
And only in the evening could you give yourself to me
Cause the night is your woman, and she'll set you free

You're too proud to say that you made a mistake
You're a coward 'til the end
I don't wanna admit that we're not gonna fit

Were never right for me.
But now I see you walkinâ around,
With that girl and I know, baby,
Know now, weâre not meant to be,
You were not meant for me.
âCause Iâm too proud, if Iâm not number one,
Then Iâd rather be lonely, lonely.

And queue up for the show.
I used to fool around and play the clown
A long, long time ago.

Another suitcase with another story
Another letter in the hallway for me.
Another chance of never being there
And then I met a girl with a curious stare

So I told you and you told her
How much I'd like to hold her.
And now I'm five years older
I wish I'd never told you
I'd like to hold you
But you keep me locked away
Locked away.

I never thought of her as being like
A consolation prize
It took some history and lots of mistakes
To open up my eyes.

And now a different girl is cutting up 'Mars bars'
A season ticket is replacing fast cars.
The curtain's up but the lights are down
The curious stare has re-emerged as a frown.

So I told you and you told her
How much I'd like to hold her.
And now I'm five years older
I wish I'd never told you
I'd like to hold you
But you keep me locked away
Locked away.

A complication in the twilight zone
The juggler fell down.
The staring girl is living on her own
The other girl is happy living with her clown.

So I told you and you told her
How much I'd like to hold her.
And now I'm five years older
I wish I'd never told you
I'd like to hold you
So I told you, and you told her
How much I'd like to hold her.
And now I'm five years older
I wish I'd never told you
I'd like to hold you
But you keep me locked away
Locked away."@@@@"King of R&amp;B, R. Kelly

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never plan that one day I'd be losing you

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one, without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one, the one, the one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay

This is the part of me

The beat went on, and I really fucking had enough
You should of seen me runnin out the studio 
Like Forest Gump
Drugged up, shutup, taxi get away
Trapped in the USA my accent is my give away
I need a bag of green to make it go away
And this is another day of my life 
And so I say...

Iâve been waiting hours for this,
Iâve made myself so sick,
I wish I stayed asleep today (yeah yeah)

Iâm so human (yeah yeah)

Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they... 

When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive,
Looking for something wild

And now we looking like pimps
In my Gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the morning
But tonight
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on,
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious.
Tear it down,
'Til the sun comes back around

And now we looking so smash
Knocking over trash cans
E'rybody breaking bottles
It's a filthy hot-mess
I'm down to get payed.
I'm not the designated driver so
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't

You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kind of heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece: I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep

Or who could wrap the swing
Around the frame the most times, back in the day
Riding our bikes around the estate
And playin' basketball in the cage, those were the days
I remember them water fights, the tap outside
Used to race to it on our bikes
Grinnin' with two front teeth missin', those days were all right
Knock down ginger, knock knock then shift
Two minutes later we got locked in the lift
Laughin' when we got out
Got into silly arguments about who found the pound on the ground
Bopped to the shops bought about ten ice pops
The weather was hot so they melted in our pockets
Used to carry my belongings in them McDonalds bumbags
That was back then so boy don't mock it

Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days I could never regret
Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days

Used to race down the hill in old Safeway trolleys
I wasn't indoors playing with Barbies or dollies
I was outside jumpin' off walls or playin' football
Or getting chased by the local pit bull
The odd character that every borough had
Mad Phillip, Gingerbeard, or Mad Max
The faces you wouldn't wanna see when you're on your jacks
In the places you wouldn't be in if you stuck to your packs
Stayed out 'til it was pitch black
Sprayed my name on concrete slabs
And I never got bitch-slapped
Seen a couple of mans get stabbed
Been chased by the mad man
Gotta get back so I can...
Catch a joke with my next door neighbor
We played the first Mortal Kombat on the Sega
Playing the latest jungle tunes we had on cassette
Those were the day I will never forget

Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days I could never regret
Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days

Remember Naf Naf jackets and spliffy jeans
Adidas campus, them things were in
It wasn't about the king of the bling
It was the king of the rim, or the king of the swing
Back then, well I kinda had less
But less was much better 'cause it saved a lot of stress
I hung out in Coffers community centre
Now they've knocked it down and replaced it with an Asda
My parents' way of tellin' us to get our backs in
Was them sounding some old fucking klaxon
We're soldier marched back up to Redcliffe Walk
Chalkhill Estate don't exist no more
It's just talk

Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days I could never regret
Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days I will never forget
Yeah, yeah
Yo, those were the days"@@@@"It's going down, I'm yellin' ""Timber""

(I never knew I) Who'da known?

(I never knew I) Fuck woulda thought?
(I never knew I) Motherfucker comes out
(I never knew I) And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I) And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
(I never knew I)

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this (Ahh)
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out (Oh my God, oh my God)
I'm sorry there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked? (Eww)
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement (The kids)
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew, I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

I never knew I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country (Hmm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun, through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screamin', ""Go,"" with their seventeen year-old uncle
I'm like, ""Guidance?
Ain't they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?""
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make-up you allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear, hmm?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse (Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin' prick)
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look)
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every three months
My life's like, kinda what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up, after I beat her fuckin' ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be
If nineteen million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew, I knew I would get this big
I never knew I knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist

I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist

A couple years ago, I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shoopitty-doo-wop (What?)
Skippity-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeve
Sonny Bono, skis, horses, and hittin' some trees (Hey)
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a teach?
Er, her, him, is it you, is it them?
""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again""
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

'Cause I never knew, I knew I would get this big

I never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch

How the fuck was I supposed to know?"@@@@"[Verse 1]
By the time you get this letter
I might be doin better
It's kinda hard trying to survive
In all this crazy weather

Everybody wants my number
Everybody's callin my name
But in the midst of all of this
I can still hear you say

Son, walk upright
And straighten yo tie
You don't want one of those good jobs to pass you by
Don't act no fool, I'm watching you
And now that you're gone
It still feels like you do, I Wish

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son
I wish u were here
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here

[Verse 2]
Now all of these people ask me
""Is it lonely at the top?...""
Or do I find comfort
In all the things I got

Well these cars keep me movin
These planes keep me high
A million dollar home
But I'm barely gettin by
Cause...

I miss our talks,
One thing u used to say (used to say)
When things got hard (Hard on me)
Get down on your knees and pray

And then those walks (then those walks)
Its just the simple thangs
We still do all of this
Bu only in my dreams, I wish

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son (you would be so proud of yo son)
I wish u were here (thats all I kno to say, thats all I kno to pray)
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here

But sometimes I wonder why
Why cant u still be here wit me?,
Wish God would've waited a couple more years for u to see
I'm tryna stay strong
Barely holdin on
I kno I'll see u again,
But for right now, rest in peace

And when I get to heaven
First thing they'll say to me
Tell me have u seen Estelle Marie Talley
Find out where u are,
Run into your arms
Wrap yo wings around me
And whisper in my ear, well done

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son
I wish u were here
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here"@@@@"We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was break me

I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me"@@@@"I ain't gone be cooking all day

And more bitter than a December
Winter night
That's how I treated you
And I know that I
I sometimes tend to lose my temper
And I cross the line
Yeah that's the truth

I know it gets hard sometimes
But I could never
Leave your side
No matter what I say

Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now,
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave I would have left by now,
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

All along
I tried to pretend it didn't matter
If I was alone
But deep down I know
If you were gone
For even a day I wouldn't know which way to turn
Cause I'm lost without you.

I know it gets hard sometimes
But I could never
Leave your side
No matter what I say

Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now,
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave I would have left by now,
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

I get kind of dark
Let it go too far
I can be obnoxious at times
But try and see my heart
Cause I need you need now
So don't let me down
You're the only thing in this world I would die without

Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now,
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave I would have left by now
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself

Cause if I wanted to go I would have gone by now,
But I really need you near me to
Keep my mind off the edge
If I wanted to leave I would have left by now,
But you're the only one that knows me
Better than I know myself"@@@@"[Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[B.o.B]
Ever thought about losing it
When your moneyâs all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side

Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge about twenty times
But still canât find no food in it

Thatâs foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is an uphill battle
But yâall tryna climb with the same olâ ladder
In the same boat, with the same olâ paddle

Why so shallow? Iâm just asking
Whatâs the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ainât a number one draft pick
Most of us ainât Hollywood actors

But if itâs all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of yours

[Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[B.o.B]
I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
Thatâs why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
For all the times no oneâs ever spoke for us

To every single time that they play this song
You can say that thatâs what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like youâre just another person

Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we wonât be near yet, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds

These are the things thatâve molded us
And if life hadnât chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where woulda wind up
'Cause if it was up to me, Iâd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey

But if itâs all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of yâall

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us"@@@@"Snoop Dogg
Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey.

Katy Perry
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
Oh oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh

California girls, we're unforgettable (California)
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle (ooh)

Wild wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most

I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah)

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach

I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

'Cause boy, we got all night long

Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch: magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your power
Stun me with your laser
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you I'll risk it all

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your love and
Fill me with your poison

Don't go changing
That's what you told me from the start
Thought you were something different
That's when it all just fell apart
Like you're so perfect
And I can't measure up
Well I'm not perfect
Just all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

It's not like I need somebody
Telling me where I should go at night
Don't worry you'll find somebody
Someone to tell how to live their life
'Cause you're so perfect
And no one measures up
Yeah all by yourself
You're all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

Now wait a minute
Because of you
I never knew all the things that I had
Hey don't you get it
I'm not going anywhere with you tonight
'Cause this is my life

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me

She was tearing us apart

Who loves me and understands
Papa, heâs quite a man
He adores me, heâs my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong,
I know heâs not perfect in your eyes
But somehow heâs flawless in mine

And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hole on my soul

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till i've had enough

Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?

You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

So I guess I'm a fool

Just want you to know

All the doors are closing, I try to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day
The day you slipped away

And I just want you to know ('cause I can't fight it)
That I've been fighting to let you go (oh)
Some days I make it through (and then there's)
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say (I have to say, I)

It's like electricity
I might die
When I forget how to breathe
You get closer and there's no where
In this world I rather be
Time stops
Like everything around me
It's frozen
And nothing matters but these
Few moments
When you opened
My mind to things
I've never seen

'Cause when I'm kissing you
My senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle
Piece I've been trying to find
Falls right into place
You're all that it takes
My doubts fade away
When I'm kissing you
When I'm kissing you it all starts
Making sense
And all the questions
I've been asking in my head
Like are you the one
Should I really trust
Crystal clear it becomes
When I'm kissing you

Past loves
They never got very far
Walls up,
Made sure I guarded my heart
I know I promised
I wouldn't do this
Till I knew it was very right for me
But no one (no one) no guy
That I met before
Could make me (make me) feel so right
And secure
And have you noticed I lose my focus
And the world around me disappears

'Cause when I'm kissing you
My senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle
Pieces I've been trying to find
Falls right into place
You're all that it takes
My doubts fade away
When I'm kissing you
When I'm kissing you it all starts
Making sense
And all the questions
I've been asking in my head
Like are you the one
Should I really trust
Crystal clear it becomes
When I'm kissing you

I've never felt nothing like this
It making me open up
Even trying to fight this
It kinda feels like it's love

'Cause when I'm kissing you
My senses come alive
Almost like the puzzle
Pieces I've been trying to find
Falls right into place
You're all that it takes
My doubts fade away
When I'm kissing you
When I'm kissing you it all starts
Making sense
And all the questions
I've been asking in my head
Like are you the one

Hey, Ms. Red Carpet
She can autograph my pockets
Anytime, anyplace, anyway
I'll be looking at everybody else watchin'
I don't wanna be obnoxious
But this girl worth the gossip
Take it with a smile
The tattoos now, forever she very guardless

I imagine her topless
She might set off my rocket
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
On and poppin'
She mad marketed
Attitude like we arguin'
With her by my side I bring glitter to my life
I should Twitter, ""This girl is sparklin'.""

She ain't no rock star but she's got groupies
She ain't no actress but she make movies
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking they neck like

She ain't a model but cameras flashing

'Cause that where she get from
They ain't never shot her with silicon
Shawty is her and her is she, the real one
Touch one, grab one, feel one

I wish she woulda told me that
Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass
She worth every bit of some Chloe bags

Like damn, can I be yo' police badge?
Pull it over, get a little cozy and
Reminisce on her like an oldie jam
Record some ssh on a Playboy cam

She ain't no actress
The movie for my mattress
Rock star, none of that practice
But still she got fanatics

She ain't no actress but she make movies

And if you don't sympathise
Tell me, how will I know who you are?

""Hi, it's me, what's up baby? I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight, so don't stay up and wait for me, okay?""
""Where are you?""
""Wait, wait, say that again?""

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, ""Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?""
I should have said, ""No, someone's waiting for me...""
But I called my girl up and said

""Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!""

Now two years done, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

""Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby

When you're looking like that

I've been trying to reach you
'Cause I've got something to say
But you're talking about just nothing at all
And you're slipping away

We were crying together
It was a long time ago
Before you walk out that door
And leave me this way
Just hear what I say

All:
You make me feel
You make me real
For the rest of my days
In so many ways
You make me feel

Kian:
I've been trying to leave you
Why should we go on like this?
But my heart can't breathe
When I hear you say
It's better this way

All:
You make me feel
You make me real
For the rest of my days
In so many ways
You make me feel

Mark:
Ten thousand light years away from you
Keep thinking maybe its time to let go
But by the end of the day
I still want to say to you...

You make me feel!

It's getting kind of wicked.
And there's no need to weep. It's more like a relief I can't stop.
Laughing and I'm thinking. You're looking at a single in gold.
I'm just your worst freakin' nightmare girlfriend.

I am such a creep. I am such a creepy kind.
Sorry, but I do believe I'm just that type of girl.
I am such a creep (and I can't help it). I ain't gonna waste my time.
And I do believe that boy just had to go.
God, I'm such a creep.

The grass is turning green. The air is loosing weight and the sun
is lighting up my bedroom.
My smile is kind of mean. I feel like I'm a dove with a gun.
I'm looking in my phonebook and there's a lot of numbers to dial.
I'm just your worst freakin' nightmare girlfriend.

I thought that I was all set
How could I be so wrong

Tell me how can I imagine
Something brighter than your eyes
No one ever came this close
And made me realize

But there are moments 
When you can't deny what's true
Just an ordinary day

I'm crying, but don't pity 
I'm dying, but just walk away 
It will be all right 

'Cause I was dreaming but you woke up 
And I'm gonna miss you but I 
am gonna be all right 

'Cause if I can't make you love me 
You're out of reasons to stay 
make it easy on yourself 
dont worry about me 
If I can't make you love me 
You're not the one here to blame 
I will make it on my own 
don't worry about me 

I'm stupid , you're smarter 
I'm stupid, thinking there's a way 
this could turn out right 

'Cause if I can't make you love me 
You're out of reasons to stay 
make it easy on yourself 
dont worry about me 
If I can't make you love me 
You're not the one here to blame 
I will make it on my own 
don't worry about me"@@@@"Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

You're dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I picture me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get 
What I want
Since you been gone

How can I put it, you put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

How come I'd never hear you say
I just wanna be with you
Guess you never felt that way

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get
I get what I want
Since you been gone

You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again

Since you been gone (since you been gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get

Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get (I get)
You should know (you should know)
That I get
I get what I want

Since you been gone
Since you been gone
Since you been gone"@@@@"Seems like just yesterday, you were a part of me
I used to stand so tall, I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight, everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong
No, I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

I told you everything, opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright, for once in my life
Now all that's left of me, is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside

Cause I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I've cried
Behind these hazel eyes

Swallow me, then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside anymore
Anymore

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces, can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes"@@@@So I'm gone with the wind
I won't look back
When I head into the future
Set sail I'm all go

When to come I don't know
But now I feel I can do it all
But leaving you
It must be so

On my way now
At the turning point here

I'm calling on you
The road ahead is long
And I must warn you

I wonder
Where did she go?
If I failed you
I tell you right now

All I want you to know
I love you
All I need is the time
To show you

Come back, my fallen son
Don't let them fool you
'Cause when the day is done
They never move you

Lay down your sense of pride
Got more than you
Put out your mournful tones
I tell you right now

All I want you to know
I love you
All I need is the time
To show you how I feel, feel

Lay down your sense of pride
Trampled once too often
I tell you right now

All I want you to know
I love you
All I need is the time
To show you

Oh yeah
You know I love you
All I need is the time
To show you how I feel"@@@@"Looking at your picture from when we first met
You gave me a smile that I could never forget
And nothing I could do
Could protect me from you that night

Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me

I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go (oh)
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say (yeah)
I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing, I try to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day
The day you slipped away

And I just want you to know ('cause I can't fight it)
That I've been fighting to let you go (oh)
Some days I make it through (and then there's)
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say (I have to say, I)
I would do it all again

I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through
And then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe (yeah)
That there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say (but still I have to say)
No, I would do it all again
Just want you to know"@@@@"Who are you now?
Are you still the same
Or did you change somehow?
What do you do
At this very moment when I think of you?
And when I'm looking back
How we were young and stupid
Do you remember that?

No matter how I fight it
Can't deny it
Just can't let you go

I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

Now look at me
Instead of moving on, I refuse to see
That I keep coming back
And I'm stuck in a moment
That wasn't meant to last (to last)

I've tried to fight it
Can't deny it
You don't even know

That I still need you
I still care about you
Though everything's been said and done
I still feel you
Like I'm right beside you
But still no word from you

No no
Wish I could find you
Just like you found me
Then I would never let you go (without you)

Though everything's been said and done (yeah)
I still feel you (I still feel you)
Like I'm right beside you (like I'm right beside you)
But still no (still no word) word from you"@@@@"Close your eyes, make a wish
That this could last forever
If only you could stay with me now
So tell me what it is
That keeps us from each other now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

Take my hand, take my life
Just don't take forever
And let me feel your pain kept inside (oh yeah)
There's gotta be a way
For you and I together now
Yeah it's coming to get me
You're under my skin

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now
Caught by the taste of your kiss (ohh)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss you

It's an illusion
How can I feel this way?
If I can't have you
It's an illusion
Nothing is real this way
If I can't have you

No I can't let you go
You're a part of me now (now)
Caught by the taste of your kiss (I don't wanna know)
And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this (I'm climbing the walls)
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss

Ohhhh
I can't let you go no

And I don't wanna know
The reason why I
Can't stay forever like this (ohh ohh)
Now I'm climbing the walls cause I miss (I miss) you"@@@@"When you come back I won't be here
She said and gently pulled me near
If you want to talk you can call
And no it's not your fault

I just smiled and said let go of me
But there's something that I've just gotta know
Did someone else steal my part?
She said it's not my fault

Then my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I was drifted in between
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah
In my dreams you are still here
Like you've always been

Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

I gave myself away completely
But you just couldn't see me
Though I was sleeping in your bed
'Cause someone else was on your mind
In your head

When I came back she wasn't there
Just a note left on the stairs
If you want to talk give me a call

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too
When the one that you want doesn't want you

My heart did time in Siberia
Was waiting for the lie to come true
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious
When the one you want doesn't want you too

Siberia, Siberia
When the one you want doesn't want you too"@@@@"Take a look around, this is what I see
Is there anybody else that feels like me, yeah
You sweat, you sweat, you bleed, you bleed
What you get ain't what you see
Up is down and black is white to me

I'm complicated, I get frustrated
Right or wrong, love or hate it
I'm complicated, you can't sedate it
I heard that song but I won't play it
It's alright, it's OK, you wouldn't want me any other way
Momma, keep on praying 'cause I ain't changin'
I'm complicated, yeah
I'm complicated, yeah

I'm smart enough to know what I don't know
I'm fool enough to stay when I should go
You work, you work, you cry, you cry
You watch your whole life pass you by
Sometimes you've got to close your eyes to see

I'm complicated, I get frustrated
Right or wrong, love or hate it
I'm complicated, you can't sedate it
Heard that song but I won't play it
It's alright, it's OK, you wouldn't want me any other way
Momma, keep on praying 'cause I ain't changin'
I'm complicated, yeah
I'm complicated, yeah

Is there anybody out there?
Just like everybody out there
Just one somebody out there, Just like me

I'm complicated, I get frustrated
Right or wrong, love or hate it
I'm complicated, you can't sedate it
I heard that song but I won't play it
It's alright, it's okay, you wouldn't want me any other way
Momma, keep on praying, 'cause I ain't changin'

Right or wrong, love or hate it

Is there anybody out there?
Just like everybody out there
Just one somebody out there
Just like me
Is there anybody out there
Just like everybody out there
Just one somebody out there
Just like me
I'm complicated"@@@@"I believed
We would last for centuries
Found it perfect
Although some did not agree
I could not imagine why we, wouldn't last
They said, we were too different and rushed
Much too fast

/Chorus:
It took one look into your eyes to know that
I will love you endlessly
Though everybody said don't bother you
Don't belong together
You decided to stand by me

We proved, them wrong
Beat the odds, together still
I kept believing
Always have and always will
I could not imagine why we wouldn't last
I am glad we rose above and beyond,
Let it pass

/Chorus

Now look what we've got and how far we
Have come
I'm so proud we're still holding on,
Staying strong

/Chorus x 2"@@@@I was your girl
Gave you my world
My everything
But you wouldnÂ´t see

I had your back
I backed you up
Whatever I did
Was never enough

Just you
You
That's all you ever thought about
You
You
No one matters like you do
What goes around comes around
You should know by now

(Chorus)
Bet you never thought that I could break you
Did you think that I would look the other way
Yeah you had it all figured out
But tell me who's the one who's crying now

The palm of your hand
That was your plan
Gave me no time
But now you want mine

It's all about take
You took too much
Nothing inside
I'm all used up

Come on
You
You
Nothing else matters like you do
You know what I'm talkin' âbout don't you
What goes around comes around
You should know by now

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
On your one night stands
(should've thought about that)
Says she's just a friend
(should've thought about that)
Are you satisfied now?
(should've thought about that)
Cause you can't hold me down
Not now
I wanna thank you 'cause now I'm free
I can breathe again and I'm never going back to you

(Chorus)

Yeah yeah

(Chorus)@@@@"I'll protect you don't be scared
No matter what I will be there
I'll be gentle I'll be light
These are the words you whispered in the night
Here I Am
Here I Am

(Chorus)
Now I'm standing in the cold
(Everything is said and done)
Atomic winter in my soul
(From the absence of the sun)
The only remedy I know
Is I got to let you go
Here I Am
Here I Am

But where were you when I was scared
A broken promise left me here
A post-it note is what I've got
It says ""I'm sorry"" but I know you're not
So
Here I Am
Yeah
Here I Am

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
There will come a day when all this is in my past
And there will come a day when you're out of my head at last
I'm trying not to fall
Damn it's such a long way down
But Here I Am

Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Chorus)

And now I'm standing in the cold
(Everything is said and done)

(From the absence of the sun)
The only remedy I know
Is I got to let you go

Here I Am
Here I Am"@@@@"A mean reply, so I scream
Another fight about nothing at all

And then we cry and forgive
Promising that we will never fall again

I know this much is true
Hey

(Chorus)
Little By Little
I think we'll understand this
Little By Little
I think we'll comprehend it
Little By Little
You'll take me as I am yeah
Little By Little

It'll take some time to find it out
To make a change, you gotta change your mind

Cause it's hard enough to get a grip
It's hard as it is without us being left behind

I know this much is true
Hey

(Chorus)

I don't care
If you don't say it
I don't care
Cuz I know it
No, we don't care

It'll take some time to find it out
To make a change, you gotta change your mind

I don't care if you don't say it
No I don't care
(Little by little)
If you don't say it
(I think we'll understand this)
Yeah
(Little by little)
I think we'll comprehend it
Little by little
You'll take me as I am yeah
Little by little

(Little by little)

We don't care

We don't care"@@@@"Hey, stay with me
As I'm getting naked
Stripped down to the bone

Hey, I'm afraid
This could get ugly
And I might leave here alone

This is not a mistake
It's the dawn of a new day
Anything goes from now

This is the last of illusions
This is the final trace of innocence
If I'm caught in the middle
I know it will be the End Of Me

Hey, talk to me
Don't play me with your silence
Whisper it in my mouth

Cause this is not about hate
It's the start of a new wave
Everything goes from now

This is not a mistake
The dawn of a new day
This is not a mistake

Hey, stay with me

Hey, stay with me
As I'm getting naked

This is the last of illusions
This is the final trace of innocence
If I'm caught in the middle
I know it will be
It's the last of illusions
Of illusions
This is the final trace of innocence
If I'm caught in the middle
I know it will be the end of me

Hey yeah..."@@@@"Six Feet Under, under my skin
There's a battle I know I can't win
You invade me
And I surrender
That's what I hate about you

Six Feet Under, under my skin
There is where your story begins
You were wanting
I was forsaken
Yeah

You came to me with words unspoken
I can't deny it
That I knew my glass would end up broken
(and that's how you got me)
I blame myself for being stupid
But I can't help it
Yet I'm eating right out of your hand
That's what I hate about you

Six Feet Under, touching my soul
From the moment we met
It was stole
You embraced me
And I believed you
Yeah

Hey, hey

It's not that hard, just walk away 
There's gotta be a different meaning

(and that's how you got me)

Now's the time for my confession
Cause I can't take it
That you always been and always will be
Under my skin"@@@@I loved you too much

You saw me
The one by my side wasn't you
I'm sorry

And I knew right then
That I lost you there
You took me in

In spite of me
You made me feel invited
Nobody else
That is what I decided

Selfish and dumb, stupid and young
Yeah, that's me
But from all of the wrongs, you make it right
And forgive me

It's been said before
But I'll try once more
You are the one

In spite of me

You carved my name into a tree
I guess you fooled me
Yeah you fooled me

These are the words you told me
These are the things you did to
Make me feel at ease
I damn the day that I met you

That's what you told me from the start
Thought you were something different
That's when it all just fell apart
Like you're so perfect
And I can't measure up
Well I'm not perfect
Just all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

It's not like I need somebody
Telling me where I should go at night
Don't worry you'll find somebody
Someone to tell how to live their life
'Cause you're so perfect
And no one measures up
Yeah all by yourself
You're all messed up

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not

Now wait a minute
Because of you
I never knew all the things that I had
Hey don't you get it
I'm not going anywhere with you tonight
'Cause this is my life

I was losing myself to somebody else
But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's was everything
Everything I'm not

But now I see
I don't wanna pretend
So this is the end of you and me
'Cause the girl that you want
She was tearing us apart
'Cause she's everything
Everything I'm not"@@@@"Lately, I've been so far gone
Pretending I don't know where I went wrong
I've been lying to myself in the arms of someone else
Without you I just can't fake it ..tonight
Here I am, so please don't tell me it's the ending

You're all I ever wanted from the beginning
I know I let you down, I'll live with that forever,
I want to scream out loud
That you're the only one that makes me better

Baby, I could barely talk to you
You got me, don't know how I made it through
Still you came with me that night, you will remember that alright
I can't believe that we could lose this tonight



I'm begging you now please don't tell me it's the ending
You're all I ever wanted from the beginning
I know I let you down, I'll live with that forever,
I want to scream out loud
That you're the only one that makes me better

Yeaa...this time I'm gonna make you right..
Oh, just take me home with you tonight

Please don't tell me it's the ending ,
You're all I ever wanted from the beginning
I know I let you down, I'll live with that forever,
I want to scream out loud
Cause you're the only one that makes me better"@@@@"You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed in everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right

If someone said three years from now you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out, 'cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever and ever
Who knew

Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no, no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

When someone said count your blessings now
Before they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever and ever
Who knew

I'll keep you locked in my head until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened

If someone said three years from now you'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and
That last kiss I'll cherish until we meet again

And time makes it harder
I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory
You visit me in my sleep

My darling, who knew
My darling, my darling, who knew
My darling I miss you
My darling
Who knew

It's cool we talk about whatever,
And yeah, you know I've been around,
My world came crashing down,
But when I'm here with you I'm better.

Tell me why it is you only smile inside
But when you break me into nothing

Over and over again
Stupid fights
Wrong or right
Goodbye...

[Chorus:]
I Remember when you came with me that night
We said forever, that you would never let me go
But here I am again
With nothing left inside
No I don't wanna but I gotta let you go

You're the one mistake
I really didn't mind
So beautiful, unmercifully
Took me down
Too little and too late
So now I know your kind
You fake it easy, just to please me
Don't you know

It's not like we haven't tried
Over and over again
Sleepless nights wrong or right
Goodbye...

So now til forever 
Stay my baby (stay my baby)"@@@@"You, you got me thinking it'll be alright
You, you told me come and take a look inside
You, believe me and every single lie
But I, I failed you this time

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right...

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

I never felt like this before
Just when I leave I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

And it feels like tonight, I can't believe I'm
Broken inside, can't you see that
There's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight

Cause there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight, tonight"@@@@There's nothing I could say to you 
Nothing I could ever do to make you see 
What you mean to me 
All the pain the tears I cried 
Still you never said goodbye 
And now I know 
How far you'd go 

I know I let you down 
But it's not like that now 
This time I'll never 
Let you go 

I will be 
All that you want 
And get myself together 
âCause you keep me from falling apart 
All my life 
I'll be with you forever 
To get you through the day 
And make everything OK 

I thought that I had everything 
I didn't know what life could bring 
But now I see honestly 
You're the one thing I got right 
The only one I let inside 
Now I can't breathe 
âcause you're here with me 

And if I let you down 
I'd turn it all around 
âCause I would never 
Let you go 

I will be 
All that you want 
And get myself together 
âCause you keep me from falling apart 
All my life 
I'll be with you forever 
To get you through the day 
And make everything OK 


âCause without you 
I can't breathe 
I'm not gonna ever ever let you leave 
You're all Iâve got 
You're all I want 

âCause without you 
I don't know what I'd do 
I could never ever live a day without you 
Here with me do you see 
You're all I need 

I will be 
All that you want 
And get myself together 
âCause you keep me from falling apart 
All my life 
I'll be with you forever 
To get you through the day 
And make everything OK 

I will be 
All that you want 
And get myself together

I got so brave, drink in hand, lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to, just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name, it doesn't matter
You're my experimental game, just human nature
It's not what good girls do, not how they should behave
My head gets so confused, hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry ChapStick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

It felt so wrong, it felt so right

I liked it"@@@@"You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah you, PMS
Like a bitch, I would know

And you overthink
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up 

(You) You don't really wanna stay, no
(You) But you don't really wanna go-o
You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery

Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

So your night would be cheaper
Did you make up your mind
About me from the start

Did you come here tonight
To find something deeper
Or did you just follow me home
'Cause you're afraid of the dark

Did you...
Did you really think you found somebody
Or did the vodka make you leave with me
Ain't it funny how you wake up runnin'
When it felt so right... last night

You can give her the world
And the eight hours later
You can't even put a face to her name
If you don't even know her
How can you hate her
You just stick to the rules
And there's no one to blame

Did you...
Did you really think you found somebody
Or did the vodka make you leave with me
Ain't it funny how you wake up runnin'
When it felt so right... last night

I promised you a part in my unwritten script
And I told you stuff like I've been waiting for you
All my life
You bragged about your hits on Myspace
And how your future looked so bright... last night

Did you...
Did you really think you found somebody
Or did the vodka make you leave with me
Ain't it funny how you wake up runnin'
When it felt so right... last night

I'm just trying to forget
Keep it real, keep it simple
And somehow just get out of bed
And this city is endless
I'm as cold as it's stone
Yeah this city is endless
And I'm, I'm walking alone

Sunlight creeps in between the curtains
Lose the sheets there's no time for sleep
I lie, I pretend âtil I'm almost certain
It's a beautiful world

I wanna ask for direction
But I don't dare to disturb
I got a thing with affections
Yeah, that's why I'm walking alone

Sunlight creeps in between the curtains
Lose the sheets there's no time for sleep
I lie, I pretend âtil I'm almost certain
It's a beautiful world

Here it comes in the morningâ¦

And people telling me what I should be
What if I'm not so crazy?
Maybe you're the one who's wrong, not me
So what you gonna do?
What you gonna say?
When we're standing on top and do it our way
You say we got no future
You're living in the past
So listen up, that's my generation

(hey ho, let's go!)
It's going down tonight
(hey ho, let's go!)
We're gonna do it till we die
(hey ho, let's go!)
'Cause I, I, I got no reason to apologize
That's my generation

(Ohh...whoa...)
(Whoa...ohh...)

I don't need to say I'm sorry
I do what everybody wants to do
It's not so complicated
'Cause I know you want the same thing too
So what you gonna do?

So sick of hearing your words, all I can hear you say
Is how you want me to live my life a different way.
I'm gonna pack up my things, I'm gonna do it just
Watch me, watch me

I'm like a rat in a cage about to lose it all
And I ain't gonna give up until I'm standing tall!
I'm gonna throw it all in, just get it over with-
Watch me, watch me

And I can't wait no more

And you're begging me please to help you
The sound of your screaming on the ground
'Cause the demons in your head have found you

I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna fix you
I know I can make it right again
I want you to see me, I need you to feel me
That's all that I wanted in the end

Hey you, take a look around, I'm beside you
I'm right here for you now
Hey you, it's hard enough to be what you want to
I'm right here for you now, right here for you now

Just turn around and walk away now
Come back, stop putting on the act
Can't I have ya just the way that I found ya?

Is it fair to say you used me? That's the truth

I'm going crazy 'cause you're hooked on someone
And that someone isn't me

Bet you never thought that I would be a psycho bitch
Like the kind of girl that's gonna smash your headlights
No, that someone isn't me

Is it fair to say your window hit a rock?
Do you think that I should sell you to the cops?
When they ask me where I was the seventeenth
Should I be like you and say it wasn't me? Yeah

Slowly sinking under, alone, yeah

So I act cool on the outside
But it's eating me alive

'Cause when it comes to you
There's nothing I can do
I can't make you love me when you don't
I see it in your eyes
I'm the compromise
No, I can't take another slow goodbye

Sitting in the park, after dark, smoking cigarettes
Biting all the black off of my nails
'Cause all I ever wanted was what you took away from me
Try to make it right, but it's too late

I'm a hopeless case on the inside
And it's eating me alive

'Cause when it comes to you
There's nothing I can do
I can't make you love me when you don't

No, I can't take another slow goodbye

No, I die
A million times every time when you look me in the eye
And lie

The same game
We go around and around
But I still end up with nothing
But hurting

Or maybe I'm proud
Can't find the truth
Can't speak my mind

Fall apart?
Or did you lie
From the start?

Such a fool
Thinking we
Were unbreakable

What's done is done
To let it go

Get out, get out, get out
Get out of my head now

When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart
No I don't believe you
When you say you don't need me anymore
So don't pretend to
Not love me at all

I don't believe you"@@@@"(Da da da da, da da da da
Da da-da da da)

I don't know if I can yell any louder
How many times have I kicked you outta here?
Or said something insulting?
I can be so mean when I wanna be
I am capable of really anything
I can cut you into pieces
When my heart is broken

Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

How did I become so obnoxious?
What is it with you that makes me act like this?
I've never been this nasty
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest
But baby I don't mean it
I mean it, I promise

Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me
I always say how I don't need you
But it's always gonna come right back to this
Please, don't leave me

I forgot to say out loud
How beautiful you really are to me
I can't be without
You're my perfect little punching bag
And I need you
I'm sorry

(Da da da da, da da da da
Da da-da da da)
Please, please don't leave me

Baby please don't leave me (No, don't leave me)

But I'd probably even do that wrong
I try to think about which way
Would I be able to and would I be afraid

Cause oh I'm bleeding out inside
Oh I don't even mind (Yeah)

It's all your fault
You called me beautiful
You turned me out
And now I can't turn back

But I'm running out of air
And it's not fair

Da da dada da dada da
Da dadadadadada da dadadadadada

I'm trying to figure out what else to say (What else could I say)
To make you turn around and come back this way (Would you just come back this way)
I feel like we could be really awesome together
So make up your mind cause it's now or never (Oh)

It's all your fault
You called me beautiful
You turned me out
And now I can't turn back
I hold my breath
Because you were perfect
But I'm running out of air

Feel as bad as I do
I have lost my mind

It's all your fault
You called me beautiful
You turned me out
And now I can't turn back
I hold (I hold) my breath (My breath)

You might think I would know better than this by now 
That I should be strong enough to resist somehow 
Even letting yourself wish is a risk, I know 
To let go and to kiss is just asking for the blow

You might think I would see clearer this time around 
Now I'm done doing payments for your crimes, I'm done

Are you looking for somewhere where you can belong?
Won't you come on over here, we got something going on

Saved my life, just in time
Saw past all my issues and scars
And made me try

But I still like it
Oh, oh, it truly feels like a dream
You know exactly how I want it

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'til now i've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter

When I believe that nothing lasts forever
You stay with me, keeping us together
And make me feel like I never ever wanna give you up
'til now I've always been a quitter
I've always been a quitter"@@@@"Oh yeah!

Monday, Tuesday, we were cool
Wednesday, I found out 'bout you
Caught my heart by tellin' lies
You weren't what you advertised

But silly me, to believe
I-I-I was unique
When I'm gone, you put on a show
Oh-oh-oh, you gotta go

Cause what's true about you?
Who are you when I'm gone?
Wanted to be with you
Don't know what I was on
Cause you got me, to forget me
Oh-oh-oh
You know that's true
Yeah you got me, to forget me
So Friday I'll be over you

You made a mistake
Couldn't say it face to face

You thought you wanted her
You got what you deserved
Now look who's getting played

They say karma goes around
I Used to want you
But I don't now

[Chorus]
Roses are dry
Violets are black
And I can be cruel 
Just like you

Tables have turned
Can't help but laugh
For saying we're thru
Just Like You

You hit me up again
To tell me I'm the one
But I just hit erase

Cuz I'm so over it
I'm finally havin fun
So drama go away

They say heartache 
Heals in time
Whoever they are
Well, they were right

[Chorus]

Tell me what she worth
Was she worth
Letting me go

Shovel in your hand 
And you're digging yourself a hole

Now you're coming back
Just to hear me tell you no
Ohh yeah, yeah

Comes around
Used to want you

Ohhh 
[Chorus]"@@@@"Hey, slow it down

And I'm doing me up with a black color liner
And I'm working my strut, but I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love

There's a thin line between the dark side
And the light side, baby tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble
Tryin' to find it

But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you, y-y-you, y-y-you, y-y-you
If I had you

From New York to LA, getting high, rock and rolling
Get a room trash it up 'til it's ten in the morning
Girls in stripper heels, boys rolling in Maseratis
What they need in this world is some love

There's a thin line between the wild time
And a flat-line, baby tonight
It's a struggle, gotta rumble
Tryin' to find it

But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money, fame and fortune never could compete

The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good
But I got you stuck on my mind, yeah

The flashing and the stage
It might get me alright
But it don't mean a thing tonight

That would be the only thing I'd ever need

More than happy, more content
But I'm at war with myself
Wrap the mirror someone else

I clammed to sorrow
Like I'm clamming to you
The only thing that I ever knew

Every beat of my heart is killing me slow
Love me to pieces oh, oh, oh, oh
Deep in the dark I sleep with the ghost
Love me to pieces oh, oh, oh, oh

I go down with this ship
If that is madness so be it
We're together never alone
When I touch you turns to stone

Now the long walk back home (back home)
There's just so many faces,
But no one i need to know (need to know)

In the dark I can fight it, I fight til I'm numb
But in the bright light,
I taste you on my tongue

Now the party's over

And now my heart is broken
Like the bottles on the floor
Does it really matter?
Or am I just hung over you?
ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Or am I just hungover?

Even my dirty laundry
Everything just smells like you (like you)

Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey.

Katy Perry
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water

Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryin' to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oooh oh oooh

California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oooh oh oooh

Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
Oh oh

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the Golden Coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love
Oh oooh

Toned, tan, fit, and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most

I mean the ones
I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (ah)

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach

I'm okay, I won't play
I love the bay
Just like I love L.A.,
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything

Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies
Just a king and a queenie

Katy my lady (yeah)
You looking here baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you representin' California (oh yeah)

You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kind of heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

My heart stops, when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby, I believe this is real
So take a chance and don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece: I'm complete

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream

There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well

It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure
It ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
Ended kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny-dipping in the dark
Then had a mÃ©nage Ã  trois

Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna sto-op
Whoa!

But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor

Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos

Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never plan that one day I'd be losing you

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

I was June and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one, without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa

Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one, the one, the one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, whoa
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away

The one (the one)

Hear no evil, or speak no evil, or see no evil
Get it, baby, hope you catch it like T.O., that's how we roll
My life is a movie, and you just Tivo

She don't wrestle, but I got her in a headlock
Yabba dabba doo, make her bed rock

I love when it's all too much
5 AM turn the radio up
Where's the rock 'n' roll?

Party crasher, penny snatcher
Call me up if you a gangsta
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?

So raise your glass if you are wrong
In all the right ways, all my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty gritty, dirty little freaks

Won't you come on and come on and
Raise your glass?

Raise your glass

Slam, slam, oh hot damn
What part of ""party"" don't you understand?

Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss âNo way, it's all good,â it didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

You're so mean (you're so mean) when you talk (when you talk)
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices (change the voices) in your head (in your head)
Make them like you instead

So complicated, look happy, you'll make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same

Woah oh, pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard and it's a waste of my time

Done looking for the critics cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves, and we do it all the time
Why do we do that, why do I do that
Why do I do that

Yeah
Oh, oh baby, pretty please

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me, yeah
You're perfect, you're perfect, oh

Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fuckin' perfect to me"@@@@"Hey, what did I do?
Can't believe the fit I just threw
Stupid
Wanted the reaction

I remember the words
How I said them, so they would hurt
But then, I regret my actions

If I could press rewind
Rewind the tape
Redefine the line
Remake my fate
Take it back in time, 
Just one day... hey

So all I need is a time machine
A one way track
Cause I'm taking it back, taking it back
All I want is a DeLorean
If I could go just like that
I'll be taking it back, taking it back

Yeah who's laughing now?
Didn't think you'd actually go
Stupid
Me and all my bitching

Second thoughts and regrets
Wanna ALT, DELETE and RESET 
But then, this ain't science fiction

If I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song

So come here a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, little question
Wanna know just how you feel

If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

'Cause you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?

Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny

There's a spark in between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So I'm asking you tonight

Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space...what?

Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, I love you

We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together...like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight

So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been

Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why

The stars were all aligned,
You, you, you, you showed up,
And blew my mind.

We didn't sleep at all,
Played records all night long,
That, that, that night,
I kind of fell in love.

Something in your kiss,
Made my body electric,
You set me free.
That night, brough to life,
For the magic that's inside,
Of you and me.

Wherever you are,
You are forever on my mind.
Wherever you are,
Know that our love will never die.

Wherever you are,
Wherever you are,
Love will never die,
Wherever you are,
Wherever you are.

Electric wire love,
The sun was coming up,
Red, red, red wine,
And whiskey on your tongue.

Tangled up in your sheets,
You saw the real me,
You, you, you, you give me,
Something to believe.

Something in your kiss,
Made my body electric,
You set me free.
That night, brough to life,
For the magic that's inside,
Of you and me.

Wherever you are,
You are forever on my mind.

Know that our love will never die.

Wherever you are,
Wherever you are,
Love will never die,
Wherever you are,

Wherever you are.

Wherever you are.

Nothin' lasts forever,
But I will always remember,
Those nights we spent together,
Wherever, wherever.

Wherever you are,
Wherever you are,
Love will never die,
Wherever you are,
(Wherever you are).

Wherever you are.
(Wherever, wherever),
Love will never die,
Wherever you are."@@@@"Couldn't help it when we met,
I was playing hard to get,
But one look and that was it;

Outside Seven-Eleven,
Fell in love on accident,

You're in for it now.

I only wanna dance with you!
Whatever I got to do,
I want you to myself,
Tonight, alright,
I only wanna dance with you.

Used to being on the road,
Crazy nights and playin' shows,
Used to dancin' all alone,
Now it doesn't matter.

Since you got a hold of me,
I'm talkin' 'bout you in my sleep,
What the hell d'you do to me?
Oh, it doesn't matter.

She'll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
'Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She'll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending
With a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it

I messed around and got addicted

New money, suit and tie

They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like

""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy

We're all so tired of everything
We wait for
Trains that just aren't coming
We show off
Our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young
But we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb
But we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears
Of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly

We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here
The lights and noise are blinding
We hang back
It's all in the timing
It's poker
He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my ace

We need love
But all we want is danger
We team up
Then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors
Are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true (ah)

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me

We sing it proudly

We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)

Teaching me to skate down the boardwalk
I'm crashing into you like a wave, uh
Even if it was only small talk
You always knew the right thing to say, uh
Maybe I was just being stupid
For thinking that my first love would last, uh-uh
Even though it ended in heartache
Sometimes I wanna go back

Walking the streets 
Of some old ghost town 
I tried to believe 
In God and James Dean 
But Hollywood sold out 

Saw all of the saints 
Lock up the gates 
I could not enter 
Walked into the flames 
Called out your name 
But there was no answer 

And now I know my heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 

Died last night in my dreams 
All the machines 
Had been disconnected 
Time was thrown at the wind 
And all of my friends 
Had been disaffected 

Now, I'm searching for trust 
In a city of rust 
A city of vampires 
Tonight, Elvis is dead 
And everyone's spread 
And love is a satire 

And now I know my heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 

There's no one left in the world 
I'm gunslingin' 
Don't give a damn if I go 
Down, down, down 
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing 
Oh, my heart is a ghost town 

My heart is a ghost town 
Oh, my heart is a ghost town

My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town"@@@@"Alone in the dark, hole in my heart, turn on the radio
And the words fall out, but they got no place to go
Wasted on you, high on the fumes

Another day, another lonely night
I would do anything to have you by my side
Another day, another lonely night
Don't wanna throw away another lonely life

No time to sleep, all that I see, are old memories of you
Yeah I try my best, but there's no one left for me to lose
Tear in my eye, I drive through the night, as far as I can from you
And I don't give a fuck if the sun comes up, yeah
It's just another

But I don't mind, I don't mind

But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

In the night she hears them calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain

In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute

Stop talking in codes

It's a mystery
I know that something happened in your history

I'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand
So many casualties of love

I'm staring at the sun!

I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way

Still you look so cool
Like a cover boy when you light the moon

I forget a lot

In the city crowd

Take me to the bus

Catching paper cuts from the paper I've counted the past year
A monster, a beast, except I'm nastier
Swift you need a favor? Then put your cash here
From the wood works now they all call

I ball through the summer, the winter and all fall

Fight it back!

Ohh ohh
Ohh ohh

We gotta fight it back"@@@@"Ahhhhhh aiiiahhhh

I wake to the sound of a far away thunder
wondering why
this secret in your heart
why don't you let me share your thoughts
something strange is going on
maybe something you've gone through
so often sadness in your eyes
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to...

(Chorus:)
Do you always have to be alone
just by yourself, just you alone
why don't you let me in
Do you have always have to go away
so far away, so far away
why can't you stay

In a place of refuge where no one's allowed
somewhere up north
where no helping hands will reach you
in your silent desert land
as captain of a peaceful phantom ship
in a proud and senseless soul
how am I supposed to help you
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to...

(Chorus:)

How am I supposed to help you
When you're in your desert land
How am I supposed to help you
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do

(Chorus)

Ohhhh
Aaaa
ohhhh
Aaaaaa

Do you always have to go away?
Baby can't you stay...
Do you always have to be alone
Do you always have to go away"@@@@"Priviet! Menya zavut E-Type! Nazdarovie!

When you are all alone just listen to the sound

Take me to the end@@@@I need you girl
I couldn't live a day without you
Well I tried to write a special song
A love song just for you
To explain the way you make you feel inside
Thought the meaning may be simple
And the words may not be new
I couldn't make it clearer if I tried
I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone I ever know
I need you
And I wanna build my world around you
I need you
I need you
Well I sang the words and realized
It had all been said before
So I tried a different rhyme that meant the same
But it didn't have the feeling
And the first one said much more
So I guess I'll have to say it once again
I need you


And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone could ever know (More than anyone could ever know)

now is the time, we're talking serious redemption
Come follow me
red light wasn't warning when I first saw her body move
I wasn't sure it was a jet stall.

I thought I had it all, now I am down and low
Memories on the wall, I have to let it go...

Chorus:
I'm free like a flying demon, no more of them filthy lies
Just free like a flying demon, this is the day of my life
I'm free like a flying demon, no more of them filthy lies
Just free like a flying demon, this is the day of my life

Why can't you see into the future?
You're going to get hurt by someone who won't suit you
they call it you destiny
But I am pretty sure now
That one who's lonely can't get hurt
She is getting stronger

I thought I had it all, now I am down and low
Memories on the wall, I have to let it go...

CHORUS

Someday it might just work but this ain't the time
This grounded flight is taking off, I leave you behind

I'm free like.....a demon....no more of them filthy lies
just free like.....a demon....this is the day of my life
I'm free like.....a demon....no more of them filthy lies
just free like.....a demon....this is the day of my life

restless searching the sun
I'm on my way, it's all a
timeless never ending story

between all open doors
So little time so many
goals left to achieve

It's OK, OK, OK,
Insecurity to live this way, I wonder?

I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm just to deep in the game
I'm not alone, no, I'm on my way home

I've changed the night to day but,
one day I'll have to pay
Mission impossible to build
a place for us two without walls
I'm living day by day
I don't have to explain
There is no other solution I'm afraid

It's OK, OK, OK,
Insecurity to live this way, I wonder?

it's irit

It's time to see
I'm gonna make you see
no more make belive, you just go...

I've got life
you're always on my mind
you gotta believe in something, alright
forever by your side
I've got life
just give me time to find
whatever it is it will be alright
forever by your side

I've got life, alright
You gotta believe in something, alright
I'm by your side..................
We're gonna live forever
don't let this be... whatever
I'm gonna make you believe in something... 'cause

if you never say never
we're gonna make it, alright

I've got life

you gotta believe in something, alright
forever by your side
I've got life
just give me time to find
whatever it is it will be alright
forever by your side"@@@@"I believed
We would last for centuries
Found it perfect
Although some did not agree
I could not imagine why we, wouldn't last
They said, we were too different and rushed
Much too fast

/Chorus:
It took one look into your eyes to know that
I will love you endlessly
Though everybody said don't bother you
Don't belong together
You decided to stand by me

We proved, them wrong
Beat the odds, together still
I kept believing
Always have and always will
I could not imagine why we wouldn't last
I am glad we rose above and beyond,
Let it pass

/Chorus

Now look what we've got and how far we
Have come
I'm so proud we're still holding on,
Staying strong

/Chorus x 2"@@@@"Stuck here for the weekend
Kickin' on a tincan, out of my mind
Stuck here for indefinite
Talking to myself, half of the time

Stone cold black 'n' blue
My memories of you
Got no future got no plans
Without a clue, what to do

When you lose your love in a dead end town
And there's no place else to go
When the rumors running around and round
And the days go by so slow
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
Until someone took it away

Stuck here for the weekend
Looking at too much time to kill
Luck has never found a home
In his not so pleasant ville

Stone cold black 'n' blue
You tore me up in two
There's no way out and no way back
Without a clue, what to do

When you lose your love in a dead end town
And there's no place else to go
When the rumors running around and round
And the days go by so slow
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
Until someone took it away

All this time I
Prayed for someone else to
Come my way and
Sweep me off my feet yeah
All this time I
Wasted in this dreadful
Lonely place that
I once called my home

I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
When you lose your love in a dead end town
And there's no place else to go
When the rumors running around and round
And the days go by so slow
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
I had a feeling
I had a feeling once
Until someone took it away
Someone took it away"@@@@I am here and now because of you
You're the reason I do what I do
Like a phantom when you call me I'll be there
Any time that I'm around you shouldn't fear

Because of you
That's what I do
Come on come on
Because of you
I'm a true believer

I'm a true believer
I'm with you through the night
You're my inspiration in life
I'm a true believer
So don't give up the fight
You're my inspiration in life
I'm a true believer

Give me give me everything you got
You and I can take it to the top
Like a super hero we can save the day
Let the music take us somewhere far away

Because of you
That's what I do
Come on come on
Because of you
I'm a true believer

I'm a true believer
I'm with you through the night
You're my inspiration in life@@@@"I will sure survive the night
there was a sleep when I come alive
I'll make it run towards the city light
it always keeps me on the right side

I will sure survive the night
there was a sleep when I come alive
I'll make it run towards the city light
it always keeps me on the right side

When we come alive
We never stop we won't give in

The time is now
We won't back down
When we stand united we can save the day
Eurofighter
It's now
We're back in town


we can do whatever, dance the night away

Deep inside made up my mind
I won't back down cause stopped at me now

When we come alive
We never stop we won't give in
When we come alive
We keep it up until we win

Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
""Goodnight, it's over with"", that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new, I've seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
""Goodnight, it's over with"", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote

""I said it's over with"", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
""Goodnight, it's over with"", that's all she wrote

T.I.
It's stupid how I'm going knowing everybody knowing that
I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat, than with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishing it was this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone
High stepping prime time
Thought you niggas been on
Ain't no blocking my shine
Like my new air Yeezy's, you can see me in the night time
I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind

Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me

Eminem
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah, you're late, your train left.
Mascara and egg smear on your face
Night's over, goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known I was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's coming up after I blindfold her,
She still comes back to my crib,
Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But I won't buy her a soda
Unless it's rock 'n' ride cola.
Buy you a bag of fritos, I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Try'na pull 5 bucks from me is like try'na pull 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch, you're already bi-polar...

Eminem
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know 'em
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

T.I.
The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with
But don't get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Your life is sure a bitch
But she know I'm rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
Peso, Euro, Yen, ah ha, I'm paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearing any chain
Never gon' see me toting anything
All you gon' see is BANG!
It's so nice where I kick it,
Hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level
But you niggas still can get it
It's all over 'fore you finish
Sorry bro, this road, we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

Eminem
Yeah I guess life is a bitcha, ain't it, TIP?
And this one can say this shit
Shirt off my back, I wouldn't give you the dirt of my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now,
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time in it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe-S on it, dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant, well, I guess I'm wrong
But if you gon' tell me that the A&amp;W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs
You can get the ""F"" on dawg

T.I.
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I'm as strong as they came
They were gone 'fore they came
Now I don't wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty, that's why

Keep staring at the phone
I'm waiting for your call
This time it was your fault

You stay away to keep me cold

To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time
And you know he's gonna be there

Backed a border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the high wire

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the souls
Fallen down from the tones
Without reading innuendos

But you found inner peace for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifter's run has a short life

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter

Give me that feeling every night

Practice what you preach
Now I know, there's nothing we can't reach

'Cause a heart can't erase
Once it finds a place
To be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter

Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands

And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight

And fall back together (back together)

Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

Twenty stitches in the hospital room
And you started crying, baby I did too

Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
But when the sun came up, you were looking at me

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

It's 2:00 AM, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Bet it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would
I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish, I wish, I

2am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I never forget you as long as I'm livin'
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything or nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood

I wish you would
I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would
I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I
I, I, I, I, I, I
I wish, I wish, I

I wish you would"@@@@"One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back

Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough

Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
Blue light reflects
The chain on your neck

He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word

And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face

Pauses, then says
""You're my best friend.""
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing
In a snow globe round your neck
And he keeps the picture
Of you in his office downtown

And you understand now why they
Lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life
Tryin' to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love"@@@@"Let me tell ya baby
Don't need no diamonds on my body
Got no green in my eyes
(Can you feel me, yeah)
In a brand new Bentley
I'll tell you now it makes no difference
Just want all of your time

'Cause you kiss me like I'm dreamin'
Like I'm one in a million
And I think it's time your figured it out, oooh
'Cause I know I got that somethin'
And it won't cost you nothin'

Turn that gold into dust

But that's not on my mind

'Cause you kiss me like I'm dreamin'

Money don't buy love"@@@@"She's off to party with the diamond dogs
From the wrong side of the tracks
Her window's open anytime she's home
But now it's locked up at last

She was bound to break free from the start
Girl got that rebel heart
She's out to rumble, gonna get it on
There ain't no stopping her now

She's off to sell herself in the seedy bar
The johns are loaded for love
She gon' get beaten playing with the dark
Innocence under attack

She was bound to be stabbed in the back
All for some fun in the sack
Now she's alone and got no one to call
Well, no, she ain't turning back

I want it all, mmm
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryin' to turn me off
I want it all, mmm

And I'm walkin' on a wire, tryin' to go higher
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all, mmm

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me anyway

Just like magic, I'll be flyin' free
Imma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, uh

And people like to laugh at you 'cause they are all the same, mmm
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game, mmm
And no matter the weather, we can do it better
You and me together, forever and ever
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing, no

We came here to run it, run it, run it
We came here to run it, run it, run it

Just like fire, burnin' up the way

I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway

Just like fire, fire

(We came here to run it, run it, run it)

So look I came here to run it
Just 'cause nobody's done it
Y'all don't think I can run it
But look, I been here, I done it

Impossible? Please
Watch, I do it with ease
You just gotta believe
Come-a, come uh with me

Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Hey, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Oh, what's a girl to do?
(What, what?)
Mmm, what's a girl to do?

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
